###### do you ever ask your self this quastion i will answerfor you 
###### computer is an electronic machine that processes informationâ€”in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end.
-Binary & Data
###### Binary data only take one of two values such as 'alive' or 'dead', 'male' or 'female'. We assign values 0 and 1 to the two states. For a single variable there are two ways of summarising the information: proportions and odds. Proportions can be classified as risks or rates.
