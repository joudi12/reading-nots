- === stric equal to .....
### there are more comparsion operators
- logical operators
### logical operators allow you to compare the reuselt of more than one comparsion operators like
- && to test more than condition ....
### there are more logical operators
- loops
### loops check a condition if it return true a code block will run
### there are three common type of loops:
- for

-  do while
## i wil ltalk about using while loobs
### this is an example of while loops
### c04/ js/while-1oop.js JAVASCRIPT var i = l ; var msg = ' ' ; II Set counter to 1 II Message II Store 5 times tabl e in a variable while (i < 10) { msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + ''; i++; document .getEl ementByid( ' answer') . innerHTML = msg;
#### It writes out the 5 times table. Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written into the variable called msg.
